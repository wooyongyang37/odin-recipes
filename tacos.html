        A taco (US: /ˈtɑːkoʊ/, UK: /ˈtækoʊ/, Spanish: [ˈtako]) is a 
        traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand-sized corn- 
        or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. 
        The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. 
        A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, 
        including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese, 
        allowing for great versatility and variety.
